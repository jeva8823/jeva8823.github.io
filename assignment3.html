    <p>
      In the Dutch culture, cheese making was taken on by farmers' wives to pass down the tradition on to their daughters.
      Today, gouda is processed industrially in demand for the gouda lovers all around the world. Although, there are still farmers
      producing gouda in a traditional sense called boerenkaas ("farmer's cheese") which is a protected form of gouda cheese made using unpasteurized milk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gouda cheese was first mentioned back in 1184. It is known as one of the oldest cheeses in the world. In the city <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gouda,_South_Holland">Gouda, South Holland,</a> the cheese got its name after the master of Gouda.
      In the Middle Ages, Dutch cities could obtain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_rights_in_the_Low_Countries">certain feudal rights</a> which gave them primacy or a total monopoly on certain goods.
      Within the County of Holland, Gouda acquired market rights on cheese, the sole right to have a market in which the county's farmers could sell their cheese. Sometimes, gouda cheese was traded in the city.
      All the cheeses would be taken to the market square in Gouda to be sold. Teams consisting of the guild of cheese-porters, identified by distinct differently colored straw hats, carried the farmers' cheeses, which typically weighed about 16 kg (35 lb), in barrows.
      Buyers then sampled the cheeses and negotiated a price using a ritual bargaining system called handjeklap in which buyers and sellers clap each other's hands and shout out prices.
      Once a price was agreed upon, the porters would carry the cheese to the weighing house and complete the sale.

      Gouda has a lightly nutty, very mild, sometimes fruity tang taste due to the aging process taking two or more years.

      There are six categories Dutch cheese makers use to classify cheese:
        <ol>
          <li>Young cheese (4 weeks)</li>
          <li>Young matured (8-10 weeks)</li>
          <li>Matured (16-18 weeks)</li>
          <li>Extra matured (7-9 months)</li>
          <li>Old cheese (10-12 months)</li>
          <li>Very old cheese (12 months or more)</li>
    </p>

      The term "Gouda" is not restricted to cheese of Dutch origin.[11]
      However, “Boerenkaas”, “Noord-Hollandse Gouda”, and “Gouda Holland” are protected geographical indications in the European Union.[12][13]
      These cheeses can be made only in the Netherlands (although not only in the Dutch provinces of South Holland, in which Gouda is situated) and can use milk produced only by Dutch cows.[14][15]
