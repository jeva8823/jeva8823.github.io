    <p>
      In the Dutch culture, cheese making was taken on by farmers' wives to pass down the tradition on to their daughters.
      Today, gouda is processed industrially in demand for the gouda lovers all around the world. Although, there are still farmers
      producing gouda in a traditional sense called boerenkaas ("farmer's cheese") which is a protected form of gouda cheese made using unpasteurized milk.

      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gouda_cheese">Gouda cheese</a> was first mentioned back in 1184. It is known as one of the oldest cheeses in the world. In the city <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gouda,_South_Holland">Gouda, South Holland,</a> the cheese got its name after the master of Gouda.
      In the Middle Ages, Dutch cities could obtain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_rights_in_the_Low_Countries">certain feudal rights</a> which gave them primacy or a total monopoly on certain goods.
      Within the County of Holland, Gouda acquired market rights on cheese, the sole right to have a market in which the county's farmers could sell their cheese. Sometimes, gouda cheese was traded in the city.
      All the cheeses would be taken to the market square in Gouda to be sold. Teams consisting of the guild of cheese-porters, identified by distinct differently colored straw hats, carried the farmers' cheeses, which typically weighed about 16 kg (35 lb), in barrows.
      Buyers then sampled the cheeses and negotiated a price using a ritual bargaining system called "handjeklap" in which buyers and sellers clap each other's hands and shout out prices.
      Once a price was agreed upon, the porters would carry the cheese to the weighing house and complete the sale.

      Gouda has a lightly nutty, very mild, sometimes fruity tang taste due to the aging process taking two or more years.
      Various sources suggest that the term Gouda refers more to a general style of cheesemaking rather than to a specific kind of cheese, pointing to its taste, which varies with age.
      Young (and factory-produced) Gouda has been described as having a flavor that is "lightly fudgy with nuts, but very, very, very mild", while the same source describes a more mature farmhouse Gouda as having a "lovely fruity tang" with a "sweet finish", that may take on "an almost butterscotch flavor" if aged over two years.

      After cultured milk is curdled, some of the whey is then drained and water is added. This is called "washing the curd", and creates a sweeter cheese, as the washing removes some of the lactose, resulting in a reduction of lactic acid produced.
      About 10% of the mixture is curds, which are pressed into circular molds for several hours. These molds are the essential reason behind its traditional, characteristic shape.
      The cheese is then soaked in a brine solution, which gives the cheese and its rind a distinctive taste.
      The cheese is dried for a few days before being coated with a yellow plastic coating to prevent it from drying out, then it is aged, during which process the cheese changes from semi-hard to hard.

    <p>There are six categories Dutch cheese makers use to classify cheese:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Young cheese (4 weeks)</li>
          <li>Young matured (8-10 weeks)</li>
          <li>Matured (16-18 weeks)</li>
          <li>Extra matured (7-9 months)</li>
          <li>Old cheese (10-12 months)</li>
          <li>Very old cheese (12 months or more)</li>
        </ol>
    <p>Many gouda lovers will pair the cheese with crackers, <a href="https://mabr5772.github.io/assignment3.html">bread</a>, fruit, and wine.
      Starbucks in particular, will pair gouda with <a href="https://jeli12.github.io/assignments/assignment3.html">bacon</a>, <a href="https://eatpants.github.io/assignment3.html">egg</a>,
      and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciabatta">ciabatta bread</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="protection-section">Protection</h2>
    <p>
      The term "Gouda" is not restricted to cheese of Dutch origin.
      However, “Boerenkaas”, “Noord-Hollandse Gouda”, and “Gouda Holland” are protected geographical indications in the European Union.
      These cheeses can be made only in the Netherlands (although not only in the Dutch provinces of South Holland, in which Gouda is situated) and can use milk produced only by Dutch cows.
